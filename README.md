# Titanic Dataset EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912. This project aims to clean the data and perform EDA to uncover insights and patterns that may have influenced passenger survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
## Repository Structure
```bash
Eda-on-Titanic-Data/
|-- Data/
| |-- train.csv

|-- EDA_On_Titanic_data.ipynb
|
|-- README.md
```
## Files

- **Data/train.csv**: The Titanic dataset used for analysis.
- **EDA_On_Titanic_data.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning and EDA.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository structure and contents.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA notebook covers the following:

1. **Data Loading and Overview**:
- Load the dataset
- Display the first few rows
- Summarize the dataset

2. **Data Cleaning**:
- Handle missing values
- Convert categorical variables to numeric

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
- Univariate analysis (distribution of individual variables)
- Bivariate analysis (relationships between pairs of variables)
- Multivariate analysis (relationships among multiple variables)

## Insights

- Patterns and trends in survival rates based on various features (gender, age, class, etc.)
- Correlation between different variables
- Impact of specific features on survival probability

## Conclusion

The EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the Titanic dataset, revealing key insights and patterns that can inform further analysis or model building.
