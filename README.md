# Titanic Dataset EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912. This project aims to clean the data and perform EDA to uncover insights and patterns that may have influenced passenger survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
